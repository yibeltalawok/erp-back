I needed an easy way to connect a Loopback application to [Firebase][7]'s NoSQL database [Firestore][6] so that i decided to build this connector.

### Installation
If you want to know how to get started with Loopback [check this][5].

To add a new data source, use the data source generator:
```sh
lb datasource
```
Then the data source generator will prompt some questions like

 - Enter the data-source name: **Firestore** *(Choose your prefered name)*
 - Select the connector for Firestore: **other**
 - Enter the connector's module name **loopback-connector-firestore**
 - Install loopback-connector-firestore (Y/n) **y**

Then you should use a service account. Go to [Project Settings > Service Accounts][4] in the Google Cloud Platform Console. Generate a new private key and save the JSON file.

You should fill the application's datasource file which is located in `/server/datasources.json`  with those details, You can find them in the downloaded JSON file from the Google Cloud Platform.

```json
"firestore": {
  "name": "firestore",
  "projectId": "",
  "clientEmail":  "",
  "privateKey": "",
  "databaseName": "Optional, Default: projectId"
}
```

#### Connection properties

| Property | Type&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| projectId | String | project_id in the JSON file | --- |
| clientEmail | String | client_email in the JSON file | --- |
| privateKey | String | private_key in the JSON file | --- |
| databaseName | String | Firebase's project id | Optional, Default: projectId | --- |

And you can actually store those private details as an Environment variables, Check [source-configuration][8]

### Inspiration
I've got inspired by the Official [MongoDB connector][3] by Loopback
